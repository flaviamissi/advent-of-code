## Problem

Find two entries that together sum 2020, then multiply them and output the resut.

For example, given the following list:
```
1721
979
366
299
675
1456
```
the two entries that sum to 2020 are `1721` and `299`, multiplying them: `1721 * 299 = 514579`,
so `514579` should be the output of the program for the list of numbers above.

## Solution

The solution should use the list of numbers provided by `input.txt`.
